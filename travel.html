        Hello there again and thank you for browsing around this site. If you’ve been dreaming a lot lately about those days of yore where we were able to go out, travel and visit new exciting places; this might be the right place for you if you need some ideas, inspiration or hope for the future to satisfy your wanderlust. All of us, including myself, have been suffering a great deal due to the current situation that’s happening world-wide with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I’m not ready
        togive up and I will do my best to continue this fight until we can get back to those days that we’ve all been longing for. Sorry for that little rant, but I hope you know that I truly wish from the bottom of my heart that I hope that anyone who’s reading this stays safe and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, I wanted to dedicate this section to some nice places that I’ve been to and both my wife and I have enjoyed a lot. Now, take in consideration that, in general, I’m a modest man, so it doesn’t really take much to make me happy, but my wife’s a bit fancier than I am and still has had a blast at these places as well. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy this little list I’ve compiled of my top 5 favorite travel spots so far!

        <li class="vactitle">Forest Gully Farms in Santa Fe, Tennessee:</li>
        <p><img class="Farms" src="C:\Users\deway\Desktop\project0\school\farms.jpg"></img></p.
        <p>As I mentioned previously, my wife and I are huge geeks and we both love Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings.  This place in the middle of Tennessee, just a couple of minutes away from Nashville, is an excellent place to stay if you’re a huge fan of Tolkien or you just need to get away for a while from your hectic lifestyle or you’re tired to be surrounded by a concrete jungle. It’s not too far away from Nashville, so you can always drive there to look for some excitement and then come back to these beautiful little hobbit houses to chill and rest for the rest of the day. The owners are extremely kind, helpful and great at communicating back with you. You get to experience nature without really compromising comfort as this place is fully equipped with everything you would be needing, and it has plumbing. Truly, Forest Gully Farms is an ideal glamping situation for those of us that enjoy nature but have no skills whatsoever to survive in the wild. Also, this place is not only great for kids, as they have their own little hobbit house to play in and lots of open space to run around, but it’s also pretty romantic if I may say so. In fact, my wife and I stayed at this place for our honeymoon and it was more than perfect. So definitely check out their website at <a href=https://www.forestgullyfarms.com/>ForestFams</a> if you’re interested in visiting this magical place.

        <li class="vactitle">The Great Smokey Mountains National Park, Tennessee</li>
        <p><img class="eclipse" id="eclipse" src="C:\Users\deway\Desktop\project0\school\eclipse.jpg"></img></p>
        <p>
          Yes, I know, another place related to nature. What can I say? The wife and I like quiet and peaceful places, but this place has a higher meaning to us as well, since we came here to witness the Total Lunar Eclipse. It was a surreal day that I’ll never forget. Laying in the grass looking up at the sky while holding her hand and feeling the change in the temperature; it was an experience like no other. However, The Great Smokey Mountains is not only an amazing place to hike, observe the wildlife,  have a picnic or feel connected in general with nature; It’s also near a bunch of nice places in Tennessee at a driving distance, including Knoxville and Chattanooga, which have many fine restaurants and attractions to visit on their own. So, if you’re up for a drive I’m sure you’d find lots of interesting things to do in the surrounding areas as well. If you end up at Pigeon Forge, you’ll find the craziest Christmas store I’ve personally been too as well.

        <li class="vactitle">Chattanooga, Tennessee</li>
        <p><img class="rubyfall" id="rubyfall"src="C:\Users\deway\Desktop\project0\school\rubyfall.jpg"></img></p>
        <p>
          I know, another place in Tennessee. We really haven’t ventured a whole lot outside of our state; however, there’s a certain magic and charm to Chattanooga that’s irrefutable. It’s a beautiful city for sure, very clean and pristine with lots of chic shops and great restaurants. It has an amazing view to the Mississippi river that would make anyone’s heart throb and interesting historical places as well such as Ruby Falls and the Art District. Also, you can visit the Tennessee Aquarium, which has two building with lots of exhibitions, the River Journey and the Ocean Journey; this place is great for kids as well since they have a lot of educational presentations, but in general really fun and chill for everyone.

        <li id="hotspring">Hot Spring, Arkansas</li>
        <p><img class="hotspringpic" src="C:\Users\deway\Desktop\project0\school\hotspring.JPG"></img><p/>
        <p>Finally, a place outside of Tennessee huh? It’s at a driving distance to Tennessee if you’re living around the Memphis-area, so that’s a huge plus if you don’t mind a road trip. Anyways, another pristine city with a lot of great shops and restaurant, but also lots of great places to go hiking such as the Sunset Trail and the Tufa Terrance Trail. I’d say that the best part of this place are the Bath Houses. It’s truly a unique, healing experience, and very romantic. I must say that the wife was extremely pleased with this getaway for sure.

        <li class="vactitle" id="neworl">New Orleans, Louisiana</li>
        <p><img class="newo" src="C:\Users\deway\Desktop\project0\school\newo.jpg"></img></p>
        <p>I mean, who doesn’t love New Orleans? It’s such a lovely city with lively people and incredible sights. The food, the architecture, the southern charm, the parties, the stores, the festivals, the haunted places, Mardis Gras; everything about New Orleans is an experience that you must live at least once in your life. From Magazine St, to Bourbon St, the French Quarter, the Garden District and the mysterious, yet beautiful cemeteries. There’s no other place like New Orleans for sure and I hope you get to visit this place if you haven’t yet.That’s it for all, I hope you enjoyed this list and I was able to give you a couple of ideas for your next trip. Thank you once again for visiting my website and I wish you the best.
