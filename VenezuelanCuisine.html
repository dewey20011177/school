      <p>This part is dedicated to some of my favorite Venezuelan recipes. My dear wife is originally from Venezuela, and she has introduced me to an ample variety of delicious dishes from her home country. To be honest, before I met her I would mostly eat chicken and rice, which she teased me plenty for it, but ow I have a great intrest for cooking and gastronomy.
        </p>
      <p>So, I've compiled over here my top 5 all time favorite Venezuelan recipes. I hope you try some of these out and enjoy them!

          <h5>Mandocas</h5>
          <p> These little Venezuelan doughnut-like food are truly incredible, and they're very easy to prepare too. They're a typical breakfast food from Maracaibo, a city within a state called Zulia. They're best served hot with butter and cheese; so you can imagine my wife's disappointment when I eat these with ketchup. Nevertheless, I'm sure these would impress your family and your friends in your next brunch plans.

            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Corn flour (Preferably "Harina Pan" brand)</li>
              <li>Panela (unrifined raw cane suger)</li>
              <li>3 rpie plantains (the riper the better)</li>
              <li>Cinnamon</li>
              <li>Ground Clovers</li>
              <li>water</li>
              <li>Cooking oil</li>

            <h5>Preparation</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Cut the plantains in halves (vertically) and place them in a pot with water. Bring to a boil. You'll notice that they'll change to a darker yellow color once they're done. Take them out of the water and set them aside to cool down. Once they've cooled down, peel the plantains and mash them until you get a purée. Set aside for now.</li>
              <li>Dissolve the raw cane sugar in a small pot with a little bit of water with medium-low temperature. Usually you can find this ingredient at any local hispanic store. It'll either look like a cone or a block of hard brown sugar. You may find it labeled as "Panela" or "Piloncillo". You can use regular brown sugar instead If you can't find this ingredient; however, they turn out sweeter and darker with the panela.</li>
              <li>Mix all of the dry ingredientes. The corn flour, ground cinnamon and ground cloves. Slowly add some water and mix until you get a soft texture, but firm enough to mold it into some shapes. </li>
              <li>Mix your dough with the puréed plantains and the panela until they're well blended together. Divide the dought in several small pieces and shape them however you want. Pro tip: if you shape them into a disc they'll have a larger surface which makes them much easier to cover with your toppings.</li>
              <li>Heat your cooking oil in a deep pan to fry the mandocas. We recommend using canola oil for frying. Fry the mandocas until they turn deep brown.</li>
              <li>Let them cool down enough so you won't burn your mouth and enjoy them with butter, cheese and a cup of coffee!</li>

          <h5>Tequeños</h5>
          <p> I can't figure out another way to describe this appetizer as a cheese stick; never call it a cheese stick in front of a Venezuelan though because they might get offended. But indeed, they are pretty much a glorified cheese stick wrapped in dough. They're truly delicious and a must in every single Venezuelan gathering. Lucky for me, these are actually appropriate to eat with ketchup.

            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Selecta brand flour tortilla mix</li>
              <li>Any semi-soft cheese (Preferably a mild cheese like mozzarella)</li>
              <li>Salt and water</li>
              <li>Cooking oil</li>

            </div>
            <h5>Preparation</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Mix the flour tortilla mix with salt and water until it has a nice stretchy texture that you can knead with your hands.</li>
              <li>Stretch the dough out and cut it in several long strips. Pro tip: this can easily be accomplished with a steady hand and a pizza cutter.</li>
              <li>Cut the cheese into long sticks and elegantly wrap them with the dough strips. Be sure to seal both ends or the cheese will just come out.</li>
              <li>Heat up the cooking oil in a deep pan and fry the tequeños until they're nice and golden.</li>
              <li>Let them cool down and enjoy with ketchup or tartar sauce! Another quick pro tip: if you fry some sweet ripe plantains first and add them inside of the tequeños along the cheese you'll have what they call a tequeyoyo (basically a tequeño with a sweet twist)</li>

            <h5>Torta Fría</h5>
            <p> Literary means "cold cake" in Spanish. This is an extremely easy icebox cake that even my wife allows me do on my own unsupervised. It's also my brother's favorite cake and we fix it for him every year for his birthday.

              <h5>Preparation</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Combine the condensed milk and the cream cheese inside of a blender.</li>
                <li>Separate the peaches from the juice and soak the cookies in the peach juice until they've soften a bit, but they're still firm enough to keep their shape.</li>
                <li>Stack the soaked cookies and the sliced peaches in a Pyrex and pour some of the condensed milk and cream cheese mixture on top. Repeat this process until the Pyrex is fully stacked with each layer.</li>
                <li>Place the cake in the freezer and leave it there over night. Let it sit outside of the fridge for a couple of minutes to thaw a bit before cutting. </li>
                <li>Pro tip: You can prepare this dessert with any fruit combination that you wish! If you want to use fresh fruit instead of canned fruit, you can soak the cookies in milk instead.</li>
