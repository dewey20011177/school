          I intend to speak briefly in this section about a couple of my hobbies. To be frank, I do enjoy an array of activities and videogames such as: The Legend of Zelda games, Path of Exile, Overwatch, The Resident Evil games, Dungeons & Dragons, The Pokémon games, and many more. However, today, because of the intrinsic nature of this assignment, I would like to focus specifically on a game, that at first glance may seem really complex and could possibly ruin friendships, but I assure it’s very entertaining and has brough me long-lasting friendships in my personal life. We’re speaking about a card game called Magic The Gathering. As I mentioned before, Magic the Gathering can be pretty complex. There are many rules and different strategies and mechanics that may affect the gameplay; however, I’ll try my best to explain the basics on this game. Essentially, the players are powerful wizards called “Planeswalker”, whom are powerful beings that can cross different planes of existence and battle each other by summoning spells with the cards. Whoever’s life reaches zero first loses the game.

          I’ll do my best to give a brief explanation of each color and what type of gaming style it entitles. <span class="greenText">Forest:</span> represented by the color green. Usually involves a natural magic. It relies on aggressive buffs and all sorts of beast creatures, werewolves, elves and druids. Suited for agro-style decks.<span class="whiteText">Plains:</span> represented by the color white. It represents civilization and consists of many creatures such as: soldiers, clerics, knights and angels. Usually white spells focus on health recovery.<span class="blueText">Island:</span>represented by the color blue. Usually this color represents knowledge and foresight. It heavily relies on spells to interrupt other players or draw cards faster from your deck. Blue decks definitely are built in a very strategic way. Some creatures you may encounter in a blue deck are wizards, spirits or merfolk. <strong>Swamp:</strong> represented by the color black. Literary it’s the opposite of white. Black decks are often associate with death and poison. It heavily relies on leaching away your opponent’s life. Your minions will consist of vampires, zombies and demons. <span class="redText">Mountains:</span> represented by the color red. Similar to green, it’s an aggressive type of magic style. It relies on strong quick spells called “Instants” to hurt your opponent, such as Fireball and Lightning Bolt along with creatures like goblins and warriors.

            In the example above, the Shivan Dragon, a Core Set 2019 card found in Wizards’ free Welcome Deck, is a creature card of the Dragon type. In the top right corner, you see the card’s mana cost. This tells a player how much mana or land you need to play this card. The two red symbols mean you need to have at least two mountain mana in addition to four mana of any color to play this card. If you have enough mana to pay this cost, you can spend the required mana and place it on the battlefield. Remember that creatures have summoning sickness when they first enter the battlefield, meaning they can’t attack until next turn (unless they the haste ability), though they can defend against incoming attacks. The Shivan Dragon’s power and toughness is located on the bottom right, and is a 5/5. This means when you attack, the Shivan Dragon deals 5 damage and it also takes 5 damage to knock its toughness to 0 (thus killing Shivan Dragon and removing it from the game). You also benefit from all abilities listed in the card ability section. In this case, Shivan Dragon gains +1/+0 for every mountain you spend on this ability per turn. While other creatures and card types have different effects once played, they all follow this same basic mana purchase system. The only difference being that creatures, enchantments, and artifacts stay on the playing field whereas sorceries and instants are placed in your discard pile, also known as your graveyard, after casting their one-time effect. You'll also need to learn how a normal turn works. Magic labels these phases as Begin, Main Phase, Combat, Second Main Phase, and End. <strong>Begin</strong> is where you Untap (turn your cards unright) and draw a card from your deck. <strong>Main Phase</strong> is where you can play a land card but only one per turn and cast creatures and other spells. <strong>Combat</strong> is where you declare attack, your opponent declares blockers,and combat damage is done. <strong>2nd Main Phase</strong> you can play a land if you did not play one during the first Main Phase and you can play creatures and cast spell again if you have mana to do so. <strong>End Step</strong> is where you creatures that did not die during combat heals and you pass your turn. Remember these phases only refer to your turn. You can still play instants and creature abilities on your opponent's turn. But if you wish to learing more on how to play Magic the Gathering from the creators I would advise you to check out this link <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena?gclid=Cj0KCQjwka_1BRCPARIsAMlUmEoSbgTczGtJwl0E7FpoykzwSJKAMcL0Bsq8w4V5IJ-LpA25q-BdFPIaAh1mEALw_wcB"> MTG website</a>

          While there are various types of card colors, there are also various types of card types, each with their own mechanics and rules about how they work:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creature:</strong> Your most basic attacker and defender, a creature spell can be anything from a demonic imp to the most pious angel. Each creature comes with an attack and defense rating in the bottom right corner, which signals how powerful the creature is, along with additional abilities listed on the card. These numbers and words help fully form the creature you’ve summoned to achieve victory on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sorcery:</strong> Simply put, a sorcery is a spell you cast directly from your hand with a one-time effect that is then discarded. You may only play sorceries on your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instant:</strong> Much like a sorcery, an instant is also played from your hand for a one-time effect. The only difference is that you may play this spell on your turn or your opponent’s turn. This gives the game an extra dimension, allowing you to interact with your opponent even when it’s not your turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enchantment:</strong> An enchantment also works like a spell or sorcery, but instead stays in play indefinitely until your opponent can find a way to dispel it. Other enchantments can also include creature enchantments which continually buff (or de-buff) a card until its dispelled or the creature is destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Artifact:</strong> An artifact works in much the same way as an enchantment, but is instead a card that usually represents a physical object rather than a magical spell. Other artifacts can also include equipment, which can make your creatures even stronger. Unlike creature enchantments, equipment stays in play even if the creature is destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Planeswalker:</strong> Sometimes you need some help from your friends. These ultra-powerful cards represent other Planeswalkers (like you) who have come to help you win your battle. These cards come with tokens and work much differently than your more traditional Magic card.
